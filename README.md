This is the clock featured in Ivan Miranda's Clock video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PixXKK8N_wA

Added Python for running on a Raspberry Pi for more control and easier(for me) connection.  Modify the GPIO Pin as needed.

I added some 3d clips to hold the LED segments in place instead of using a glue gun.  I found the clips were a lot cleaner and easier to assemble.
